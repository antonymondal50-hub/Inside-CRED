Product Analytics: Reverse-Engineering CRED's Business Model
Project Overview
This is a data-driven case study and dashboard created to deconstruct the business model of CRED, a leading Indian fintech unicorn. As a personal project, the goal was to simulate the role of a Product Analyst or Product Manager, leveraging publicly available data to reverse-engineer key business metrics, analyze growth drivers, and provide strategic product recommendations.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with ambiguous data, think critically about a company's strategy, and visualize complex findings for a non-technical audience.
